# lab2-rob-glazer
This is the second lab (of two labs) of a person named Rob Glazer

I will now copy and paste a screenplay I've been working on. It's a family drama that explores human psychology on a sociological level 


PERSON 1: Can I have some coffee?

PERSON 2: Yes you can have some coffee. Hey Person 3, can you get some coffee for Person 1?

(Multiple minutes pass)

(PERSON 3 enters the room)

PERSON 3: Here is the coffee that I was told to bring in

PERSON 1 and PERSON 2 (in unison):
Thank you Person 3!

(PERSON 1 takes coffee and begins sipping)

PERSON 1: This is good coffee

PERSON 2: Thank you 

PERSON 1: What beans did you use to make this coffee

PERSON 2: I did not make it. Person 3 made it. 

PERSON 1: Hey Person 3, what beans did you use to make this coffee. 

PERSON 3: Stumptown Coffee Roasters Holler Mountain Beans

PERSON 1: Okay

PERSON 3: Hey Person 1

PERSON 1: Yes?

PERSON 3: I think I am in love with you

(Credits roll)

(Many years pass)

(PERSON 1 and PERSON 2 are sitting in the kitchen in an old, battered colonial home)

PERSON 1: Hey do you remember Person 2?

PERSON 3: Yes of course, he was the best man at our wedding. How is he doing?

PERSON 1: He passed away today. I saw it in the paper. You know, it's funny. He used to be my closest friend. Growing up, he was like a brother to me. And now, he's just gone. 

PERSON 3: He was a great man. I wish we all kept in touch. How did he go? 

PERSON 1: I don't know. I can't say I even want to know. It's weird, I just don't feel the way I thought I would.

PERSON 3: Emotions can be complex. Nobody can really explain grief. 

PERSON 1: It's not that. It just doesn't feel real, you know? It feels like if we just drive out a few hours to the country-side, he'll be there, and it'll just be normal. Maybe it's just been so long since I've seen him.

PERSON 3: We should pay our love to his family. Person 4 has always been so sweet, I can't even imagine how she's taking it all. 

PERSON 1: Do you ever feel like it's all too much? Here we are, just floating around on a giant rock. Sometimes I just look out at the stars, and they're just, they're so far away. To them, I'm a speck. No, not even a speck. I'm nothing. I don't know what I'm trying to say. I think I need to lay down for a minute. 

PERSON 3: Let's go get some fresh air. 

PERSON 1: We can't do that because there is a zombie apocalypse happening right now, remember?

PERSON 3: Oh yes right I forgot 

(Multiple zombies break down the front door)

PERSON 1: Look out! 

(PERSON 1 and PERSON 3 flee)

PERSON 3: We can't hold them off! There's too many! What can we do??

PERSON 1: Person 3, I want you to listen to me very carefully. There is an old farm out West, and you'll find a man named Person 5 there. I want you to find him, he will take care of you. 

PERSON 3: What are you saying?

PERSON 1: I'm sorry Person 3. I need you to run. I can hold them off

PERSON 3: No! Please, don't do this...

PERSON 1: It's the only way. I love you. 

PERSON 3: Wait where is the farm? Could you be more specific?

PERSON 1: Goodbye. 

(PERSON 1 runs towards the zombies. PERSON 3 hesitates for a moment, and runs)
